<h1>HTML Course Notes</h1>

<!--This is what I learned in the HTML section of the course-->

			<h3>Anyone can learn anything</h3>

			<p>Why am I doing this? For years I have felt like I have been trapped in a dead end job with no potential for any real advancement. When I gave birth to my son a year ago, it was a no brainer for me to leave my job in the insurance industry. I have some time to figure out what I want to do next and I know I do not want to go back to the world of insurance.</p>

			<p>I have tried learning how to do some basic coding in the past. I did a few projects here and there and helped maintain a wordpress website. It never really stuck with me though. I really hope that this time I can really understand the fundamentals and continue along this track in the future.</p>

			<p>I know I am not going to remember everything I see in this course and I have to know where to go to keep my skills up and look for answers. Two great resources will be <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>. These sites will be especially helpful since I am <b>bad</b> at taking notes. It has been a long time since I have been in a learning situation. I am out of practice.</p>

			<h3>It's all coming back... sort of</h3>

			<p>I remember most of the tags that were presented in this section of the course. It was great being able to easily recognize the <b>bold</b> tag. I am not sure I ever used the <em>italics</em> tag before and was surprised it was not &lt;i&gt;. Most tags require you to open and close them. Images do not have a closing tag and <br>neither do line breaks. </p>

			<p>I recall using divs in old projects but I did not know there was an option to use a span tag. I still don't completely understand the difference between inline and block. I am only accustomed to using block elements. <span>I have not used the span tag before.</span></p>

			<p>This covers what I took notes on. I am looking forward to moving on to the next section.</p>

			<h3>Style, sytle and more style</h3>

			<p>The next section of the course was all about css. It is really cool how you can take html and make it look completely different using css. I am looking forward to actually playing around with this soon to see how creative I can be.</p>

			<p>Webpages are broken up into boxes and these boxes will help me breakdown my project into manageable chunks. We also briefly talked about classes and how you can create them and use them to refer to more than one element in your css.</p>
